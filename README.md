# adept-workout-tracker - a lightweight, reliable and flexible fitness progression app.


<em>This project is still in early development. </em>

Most of the fitness tracking apps on both the iOS and Android platforms less a tool but more a chore. They have one common issue: flexibility. While they aim to ease users by providing a sort of database for available exercises, this can be counter-intuitive as users are forced to only select the exercises and format provided by the database itself. Moreover, most apps does not account variability such that a person might change a workout dynamically throughout its cycle. These advanced techniques require flexibility in storing the workout data, and this is what this application aim to tackle. With Adept, we will ensure gym-goers all the tool they need to track their workouts effectively without gimmicks.

This project aims to have a web component as preview for the actual desktop/mobile application. With C#, Blazor and .NET MAUI this project aims to share a unified UI library that can be compiled for the desired platform.
